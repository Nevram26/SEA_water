            <h3>What is SDG?</h3>
            <h3>What is SDG 6?</h3>
            <h3>Why SDG 6 Matters</h3>
            <p id="parag1">The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a universal call to action set by the United Nations to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. There are 17 goals in total, each addressing different global challenges that require urgent attention and action.</p>
            <p id="parag2">SDG 6 focuses on Clean Water and Sanitation, aiming to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for everyone. This goal addresses critical issues like water scarcity, inadequate water infrastructure, and poor sanitation, which affect billions of people worldwide.</p>
            <p id="parag3">The water crisis is one of the most pressing issues globally, with 2.2 billion people lacking access to safe drinking water and 4.2 billion without adequate sanitation. Poor sanitation and unsafe water sources lead to diseases and environmental degradation. Raising awareness and taking action can help prevent waterborne illnesses, protect water ecosystems, and ensure equitable access to clean water and hygiene for all.</p>
