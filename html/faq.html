                <div>
                    <p>
                        SDG 6, part of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, aims to ensure the availability and 
                        sustainable management of water and sanitation for all by 2030. 
                        It addresses issues such as water scarcity, water quality, sanitation access, and ecosystem protection.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Access to clean water and proper sanitation is fundamental to human health and development. 
                        It prevents diseases, supports sustainable ecosystems, and promotes dignity and safety. 
                        Achieving SDG 6 is critical for reducing poverty and building resilient communities.

                    <p>

                        and lack of awareness. Climate change, population growth, and industrialization 
                        also place additional strain on water resources.
