                United Nations to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. There are
                17 goals in total, each addressing different global challenges that require urgent attention and
                action.</p>

            <h3 class="h3-right">What is SDG 6?</h3>
            <p class="p-right">SDG 6 focuses on Clean Water and Sanitation, aiming to ensure the availability and
                sustainable management of water and sanitation for everyone. This goal addresses critical issues
                like water scarcity, inadequate water infrastructure, and poor sanitation, which affect billions of
                people worldwide.</p>

            <h3 class="h3-left">Why SDG 6 Matters</h3>
            <p class="p-left">The water crisis is one of the most pressing issues globally, with 2.2 billion people
                lacking access to safe drinking water and 4.2 billion without adequate sanitation. Poor sanitation
                and unsafe water sources lead to diseases and environmental degradation. Raising awareness and
                taking action can help prevent waterborne illnesses, protect water ecosystems, and ensure equitable
                access to clean water and hygiene for all.</p>
